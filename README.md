# Book a taxi MEAN App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.1. It was built with the purpose of simplifying taxi booking for dispatchers. The dispatchers were having a lot of paper trail and sending tons of emails through out the day to communicate with the taxi company. To avoid this and to aid dispatchers save time for other important work, we have created this app. The software development lifcyle process will continue and many bug fixes and important update will continue to be made to this app in the coming months. Asynchronous tasks such as accessing the API server and othere third-party API's were done by using RXJS on the frontend. The application has been deployed using AWS Elastic bean and can be found by going here `http://bookataxi.sharpbuslines.com`. MOngoDB was used for database to store user id and form data. Express and Node.js `https://expressjs.com/` was used for creating the server, routing and middleware. JWT (JSON WET TOKEN) was used to decrypt user passwords, document for it can be found on `https://jwt.io/`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. For the backend file you could run, `npm run start:server`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build. If you use the `--prod` flag a minified angular folder will be created in the backend folder. If this is the case, you don't have to use `ng serve` for the angular files as both files will be in the backend folder and just running `npm run start:server` will make the app available on `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Running unit tests

No test scripts are included, if there were any tests you could have run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
